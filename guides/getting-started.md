## Understanding PromptAtlas

PromptAtlas is a comprehensive collection of AI development prompts designed to help you leverage AI assistants more effectively. The repository is organized into:

- **Prompt Templates**: Domain-specific and language-specific prompts for various development tasks
- **Tool Configurations**: Custom settings for AI tools like Cursor and GitHub Copilot
- **Guides**: Documentation on how to use and contribute to the repository

Each prompt follows a standardized format to ensure consistency and ease of use.

## Finding the Right Prompt

### By Domain

If you're working on a specific type of development, browse the corresponding domain folder:

- **Cloud Development**: AWS Lambda functions, serverless applications, cloud architecture
- **Frontend Development**: React applications, components, performance optimization
- **Backend Development**: APIs, databases, microservices
- **Mobile Development**: React Native, Flutter, native apps

### By Language

If you prefer to search by programming language:

- **Python**: AI/ML engineering, general Python development
- **TypeScript**: Next.js, React, web development
- **Other Languages**: Additional language-specific prompts

### By Pattern

If you're looking for specific architectural or design patterns:

- **Architecture Patterns**: System design approaches
- **Optimization Patterns**: Performance improvement strategies
- **Testing Patterns**: Testing methodologies and best practices

## Customizing Prompts

Each prompt template includes parameters enclosed in square brackets (e.g., `[PARAMETER]`). To customize a prompt:

1. **Identify Parameters**: Look for bracketed text like `[RUNTIME]` or `[FRAMEWORK]`
2. **Replace Values**: Substitute with your specific requirements
3. **Add Context**: Provide additional details relevant to your project
4. **Remove Sections**: If a section isn't relevant, you can remove it

### Example

Original template section:
```markdown
Function Specifications:
- Runtime: [RUNTIME]
- Memory: [MEMORY]
- Timeout: [TIMEOUT]
```

Customized section:
```markdown
Function Specifications:
- Runtime: Python 3.11
- Memory: 1024 MB
- Timeout: 30 seconds
```

## Using AI Tool Configurations

PromptAtlas includes configurations for various AI assistants:

### Cursor AI

1. Navigate to the `tools/cursor/` directory
2. Copy the desired configuration files to your `.cursor/rules` directory
3. Reference these files when starting a Cursor AI conversation

### GitHub Copilot

1. Find Copilot configurations in the `tools/copilot/` directory
2. Follow the instructions in each file to configure Copilot for your needs

## Advanced Usage

### Combining Prompts

You can combine multiple prompts for complex projects. For example:

1. Start with a domain-specific architecture prompt
2. Add language-specific implementation details
3. Include pattern-specific optimizations

### Creating Custom Templates

If you have specific needs not covered by existing templates:

1. Start with the closest matching template
2. Customize parameters and sections
3. Consider contributing your template back to the repository
