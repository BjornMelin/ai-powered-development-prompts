# Implementation Summary

## Completed Steps

1. **Created a new branch** following Conventional Commits:
   - `feat/cursor-ai-agent-template`

2. **Added the Ultimate Cursor AI Agent Template** in a new directory:
   - Created `rules/cursor-ai-agent/` directory
   - Added `README.md` with comprehensive documentation
   - Added `system_prompt.md` for Cursor AI instructions
   - Added `project_config.md` template for Long-Term Memory
   - Added `workflow_state.md` template for Short-Term Memory

3. **Updated repository documentation**:
   - Enhanced `README.md` with new sections and improved structure
   - Updated `repository-structure.md` to include the new directory
   - Created `PR_DESCRIPTION.md` with detailed PR information

4. **Committed and pushed the changes** to the feature branch

## Next Steps

Due to repository rules requiring changes through pull requests, you will need to complete these steps manually:

1. **Create a Pull Request**:
   - Go to: https://github.com/BjornMelin/ai-powered-development-prompts/pull/new/feat/cursor-ai-agent-template
   - Use the content from `PR_DESCRIPTION.md` as the PR description
   - Submit the PR for review

2. **Review and Approve the PR**:
   - Review the changes
   - Approve and merge the PR

3. **Cleanup**:
   - After merging, you can delete the feature branch if desired
   - Pull the changes to your local main branch

## Directory Structure Added

```
rules/
└── cursor-ai-agent/
    ├── README.md                   # Overview and instructions
    ├── system_prompt.md            # System prompt for Cursor AI
    ├── project_config.md           # Long-term memory template
    └── workflow_state.md           # Short-term memory and rules template
```

## Final Notes

The implementation follows the Git Feature Branch Workflow with Conventional Commits as specified in the attached file. The template itself represents a comprehensive synthesis of best practices from the Cursor AI community, combining detailed structure with a streamlined, autonomous approach to AI-assisted development.
